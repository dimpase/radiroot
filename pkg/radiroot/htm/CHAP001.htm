<h1>1 Introduction</h1><p>
<p>
The main functionality of this package is to solve a rational polynomial by
radicals and display the solution. That is possible iff the Galois group of
the polynomial -- a permutation group on its roots -- is solvable. This fact
has first been discovered by &Eacute;variste Galois (1811 -- 1832), on whose ideas
this implementation is based. The implemented algorithm is discribed in
<a href="biblio.htm#Distler05"><cite>Distler05</cite></a>.
<p>
The package creates a LaTex file for the radical expression. Therefore you
need a Latex compiler and the dvi viewer xdvi, to use the main
functionality.  
<p>
In addition to the readout you get several results in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>. Some of them can
be computed on their own. This are the splitting field of a rational polynomial
and its Galois group as a permutation on the roots.
<p>
This package uses the interface to KANT <a href="biblio.htm#KANT"><cite>KANT</cite></a> in the package Alnuth to
factorize polynomials over algebraic numberfields. This functionality must
be available to use the functions in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Radiroot</font>.
