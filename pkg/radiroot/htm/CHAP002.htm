<li><code>IsSolvable( </code><var>f</var><code> )</code>
<a name = "SSEC001.1"></a>
<li><code>IsSolvablePolynomial( </code><var>f</var><code> )</code>
<p>
returns <code>true</code> if the rational polynomial <var>f</var> has a solvable Galois group and
<code>false</code> otherwise. It signals an error if there exists an irreducible factor
with degree greater than 15.
<p>
For a rational polynomial <var>f</var>
<a name = "SSEC001.2"></a>
<li><code>SplittingField( </code><var>f</var><code> )</code>
<p>
returns the smallest field, constructed with <code>FieldByPolynomial</code>, that
contains all roots of <var>f</var>. 
<p>
<a name = "SSEC001.3"></a>
<li><code>GaloisGroupOnRoots( </code><var>f</var><code> )</code>
<p>
calculates the Galois group <var>G</var> of the rationals polynomial <var>f</var> as a
permutation group with respect to the ordering of the roots of <var>f</var> given as
matrices in <var>G!.roots</var>.
<p>

<h2><a name="SECT002">2.2 Solving a polynomial by radicals</a></h2>
<p><p>
<a name = "SSEC002.1"></a>
<li><code>RootsOfPolynomialAsRadicals( </code><var>f</var><code> )</code>
<p>
computes a solution by radicals for the irreducible, rational polynomial <var>f</var>
up to degree 15 if this is possible, e. g. if the Galoisgroup of <var>f</var> is
solvable. The result is displayed in form of a dvi-file. Additionally a record
is returned which contains the roots of <var>f</var> as a list <code>roots</code> of matrices, the
Galois group on the roots as component <code>galgrp</code>
and the splitting field of <var>f</var> in two forms; on the one hand the
matrix field  <code>K</code> generated by the roots and on the other hand an algebraic
number field  <code>H</code> created by the defining polynomial of the matrix field. The
record also includes a list <code>cyclics</code> of matrices which define the splitting
field by gradual, cyclic extensions.
<p>
The computation may last very long and doesn't finish for every example if the
degree of <var>f</var> is greater than 7.
<p>
<a name = "SSEC002.2"></a>
<li><code>RootsOfPolynomialAsRadicalsNC( </code><var>f</var><code>, </code><var>display</var><code> )</code>
<p>
does essentially the same as <code>RootsOfPolynomialAsRadicals</code> except that you can
choose if you want to create a dvi-file and display it by setting the boolean
<var>display</var>. The function performs no test whether the polynomial <var>f</var> is
irreducible. It also doesn't check at the begining if <var>f</var> is solvable, but can
therefore be used for polynomials with arbitrary degree.
